        <p>I learned to code after I fell in love with text-based games like Zork, A Dark Room, and Candy Box. With just a few languages under my belt, I'm technically still a baby to the big bad world of web development, but I'm slowly learning my way through PHP and Lua (when I'm not getting distracted writing movie reviews or scripts to choice-based games).</p>

        <p>Most of the websites I've built are apps on Ruby on Rails & React, or static HTML/CSS landing pages for SMEs who are branching into the digital market and need to establish a lasting web presence. You can see some of my work below, or if you prefer something more fun - you can check out my recommendations for an endless and perpetually-growing list of ways to waste time.</p>

        <div class="text">Fin-Man is a financial management (see the pun?) app, made entirely on Ruby on Rails. The biggest challenge was learning to find and integrate the correct gems for our app, some of which relied on dependencies that were out of date and no longer maintained.<br>In the end, we didn't manage to code all the features we wanted, but it was still a great and rewarding experience considering we only had a couple weeks to finish it.</div>

        <div class="text">Caravan is just another Airbnb clone, except instead of flats the idea was to rent - you guessed it! - cars. As my first team Rails project, it was a steep learning curve to discover how to delegate tasks and collaborate on features we all had conflicting ideas about. Being responsible for individual features was an experience I hadn't had as a sole developer, and definitely taught me the importance of writing clear and clean code.</div>

        <div class="text">The SG Boys were an LGBT podcast based in the little red conservative dot where homosexuality is still (politically) illegal. This was a static website written entirely in HTML and CSS. My challenge was to do this entirely without using Bootstrap or other frameworks for the layouts / utilities / grids. Though I managed to make it look (reasonable) on desktops, I never made the website responsive for smaller screens.</div>
